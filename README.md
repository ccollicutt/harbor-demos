# Harbor Demos

This repository contains a set of Harbor container image registry demos.

* [Deploy Harbor Locally into Kind](install-harbor-kind.md): In this lab we deploy Harbor into a local ["Kubernetes in Docker" aka Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) installation. Currently this lab assumes MacOS.
* [Basic Deployment of Harbor with Helm](basic-harbor-helm.md): In this demo we deploy Harbor to a Kubernetes cluster created by [vSphere with Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid). The Helm chart used for the deployment comes from the [Tanzu Application Catalog](https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-catalog).
